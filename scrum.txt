Sprint 1 - Meeting 1:
    Agenda
        - Discussing how much front end work has been completed
        - Discussing how many tasks each member has completed
        - Discussing any challenges each member had so far and how to overcome them
    Accomplishments
        - Completed GUI for varying end users
        - Set up database connection for communication with server
    Plans
        - Finishing up the rest of the GUIs for all end users  
        - Implement all HTTP request
    Minutes
        Our very first meeting consisted of discussing how we were going to delegate the tasks.
        This was done after determining the roles each member had, which was split into front-end, 
        back-end, and project manager. Alex Keener and Reagan Reitmeyer had the back-end roles, 
        David Asatryan and Sry Hak had the front-end roles, and Emily Ha had the project manager role. 
        We all brainstormed how to split the tasks into smaller chunks and laid out an initial product backlog, 
        including what would be done by the first sprint as a minimal viable product. Our team decided to use React,
        HTML, CSS and Javascript for this project as it would work the best for our purposes.

Sprint 1 - Meeting 2:
    Agenda
        - Discussing what everyone has completed since the last scrum meeting
        - Discussing any issues with current work
    Plans
        - Finish the HTTP requests so that we can finish up the front end displays
        - Implementing more functionality for backend processes
    Minutes
        We discussed our current tasks on hand and any issues related to the process. We also discussed any tasks 
        completed since the first meeting about the project and the difficulties. One of the difficulties was just 
        the process of learning React and the syntax involved. There were more discussions on switching the assignment
        of tasks so that the project manager can help more when needed. As a result, more tasks will be assigned to the
        project manager from the sprint backlog.


Sprint 1 - Meeting 3:
    Agenda
        - Discussing any tasks that anyone is having trouble with
        - Discussing the tasks that have been completed
        - Demoing to the team functionality of the newly completed tasks
    Plans
        - Finish debugging backend functions
        - Implement all HTTP requests to display data on frontend
    Minutes
        We discussed any issues with our assigned tasks and finalized what needed to be done as a minimal viable product 
        for the first sprint. We ended up determining that some tasks previously assigned to the first sprint were not necessary 
        due to the time constraint we are on for the upcoming deadline. As a result, those tasks are assigned to the second sprint. 
        One issue discussed was Alexâ€™s task where the postman server request would send back data before the function completed and 
        update the variables that would be returned to frontend. We brainstormed possible solutions such as waiting on threads but none 
        have worked so far.
