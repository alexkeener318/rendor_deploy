        Our very first meeting consisted of discussing how we were going to delegate the tasks.
        This was done after determining the roles each member had, which was split into front-end, 
        back-end, and project manager. Alex Keener and Reagan Reitmeyer had the back-end roles, 
        David Asatryan and Sry Hak had the front-end roles, and Emily Ha had the project manager role. 
        We all brainstormed how to split the tasks into smaller chunks and laid out an initial product backlog, 
        including what would be done by the first sprint as a minimal viable product. Our team decided to use React,
        HTML, CSS and Javascript for this project as it would work the best for our purposes.
